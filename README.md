:fire: Project Introduction  

We provide the VQPPF module interface proposed in the MtvTrack paper, along with instructions for training and inference tracking algorithms. The module folder contains implementations of the proposed methods, while the APIInterfaceUsageExamples folder provides examples of VQPPF tracking. You can follow these examples to use the VQPPF module to predict time-varying target states.
